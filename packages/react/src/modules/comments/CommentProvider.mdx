# Comments

The `CommentProvider` component allows you to add a comments section to your app. It provides a complete comments system with the ability to create, edit, delete comments and reply. The component can be used in read-only or edit mode and includes configurable options for maximum comment length, number of comments displayed, and number of replies allowed. All comment actions (post, edit, delete) can be customized through callback functions.

<Canvas of={commentStories.Base} />

## Install

- You need to install `@edifice.io/react`.
- `CommentProvider` is exported as a sub-module.

```
import { CommentProvider } from '@edifice.io/react/comments';
```

## Comment

The structure of a comment object must conform to this interface. If not, you must transform your content before passing comments as a prop.

```
interface CommentProps {
  id: string; // Comment ID
  comment?: string; // Comment text
  authorId?: string; // Author ID
  authorName?: string; // Name of the author of the comment
  createdAt: number; // Date when the comment was created
  updatedAt?: number; // Date when the comment was updated
  deleted?: boolean; // Flag to indicate if the comment is deleted
  replyTo?: string; // ID of the comment to which this comment is a reply
}
```

## Type prop

The `CommentProvider` expects a `type` prop with one of the following values:

```
CommentType = "read" | "edit";
```

It will determine if you authorize creating and editing comments or just displaying a list of comments (e.g., print page).

## Creating a new comment

By passing `type='edit'` to the `CommentProvider`, it will expect the `comments` and `callbacks` props.

<Canvas of={commentStories.CreateComment} />

You need to pass an event handler to the `post` key in the `callbacks` prop to create a new comment.

```
post: (comment: string) => Promise<void>
```

## Update a comment

If you have a comment, you can update it by clicking on the Update button.

<Canvas of={commentStories.UpdateComment} />

You need to pass an event handler to the `put` key in the `callbacks` prop to update a comment.

```
put: ({comment, commentId}: {comment: string; commentId: string;}) => Promise<void>;
```

## Delete a comment

If you have a comment, you can remove it by clicking on the Delete button.

<Canvas of={commentStories.DeleteComment} />

You need to pass an event handler to the `delete` key in the `callbacks` prop to delete a comment.

```
delete: (commentId: string) => Promise<void>;
```

## Reply to a comment

You can reply to a comment by clicking on the Reply button.

You can limit the number of replies displayed by setting the `maxReplies` option.

You can also load more replies by clicking on the Load More button. The number of replies loaded is determined by the `additionalReplies` option.

Only one level of replies is supported.

<Canvas of={commentStories.ReplyComment} />

You need to pass an event handler to the `post` key in the `callbacks` prop, with the replyTo parameter set to the ID of the comment to which you are replying.

```
post: (comment: string, replyTo?: string) => Promise<void>
```

## Callbacks

As mentioned above, the `callbacks` prop needs three keys/methods to work: `post`, `put`, and `delete` to create, update, or remove a comment.

- The post method returns the newly created comment. In case of a comment reply, use the replyTo parameter to specify the comment to which the new comment is a reply.

```
post: (comment: string, replyTo?: string) => Promise<void>
```

- The put method returns the updated comment along with its ID.

```
put: ({comment, commentId}: {comment: string; commentId: string;}) => Promise<void>;
```

- The delete method returns the commentId of the comment to be deleted.

```
delete: (commentId: string) => Promise<void>;
```

You can manage all three of these methods however you like in your code, but they need to be asynchronous. For instance:

```
const handleOnPutComment = async ({ comment, commentId }) => {
  await updateComment({ comment, commentId });
};
```

## Options

`CommentProvider` accepts a prop called `options` to configure its behavior.

<Canvas of={commentStories.OptionsComments} />

```
type CommentOptions = {
  maxCommentLength: number; // Setting the text limit on a comment
  maxReplyLength: number; // Setting the text limit on a response
  maxComments: number; // Limit for displaying comments in the list
  additionalComments: number; // Number of comments to load additionally in the limited list
  maxReplies: number; // Limit on displaying replies to a comment
  additionalReplies: number; // Number of replies to load additionally in the limited list
  allowReplies: boolean; // Falsy when the Reply button must be hidden
};
```

### Limit Comments

Configure `maxComments` with a number to limit the list of comments displayed and change the default value of `additionalComments` to show more comments.

<Canvas of={commentStories.ReadMoreComments} />

### Hide the Reply button

You can hide the reply button by setting the `allowReplies` option to `false`.

<Canvas of={commentStories.HideCommentButton} />

## Read-only comments

By passing `type='read'` to the `CommentProvider`, it displays the comments and disables any interaction.

<Canvas of={commentStories.ReadComments} />
